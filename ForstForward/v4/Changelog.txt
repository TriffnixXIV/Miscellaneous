Mechanics:
	- actions now scale with rounds instead of druids
	- "Sprout" scales way better (+1 every 10 rounds instead of every 5 druids)
	- max druid spawn count now increases by 1 every 20 rounds
	- villager pathfinding is better (and more performant again)
	- reworked druid pathing
	- added a new action: "Spawn a treant"
		a treant will trample houses. Action starts occuring when Horst becomes too powerful
	- added a new action: "Plant N, then Sprout M", which starts occuring later on

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- cursor highlight now updates properly after successfully performing an action
	- there's now a mute button (you may also press "M" to mute the game)
	- VFX are now clipped to the map properly (preventing out-of-bounds druid circle and lightning visuals)
	- press "S" to skip your turn
	- press "ESC" to return to the *new* menu
	- records can now be reset
